# Hi there 👋
My name is René 
<!--
and I'm a PhD and researcher in the fascinating area between statistics and deep learning. I'm on a mission to make neural networks a bit more transparent and statistical models a bit more interesting!
I currently work as a data and AI scientist for EWE AG, where my job is to translate new and interesting insights from the digital world of numbers and data into the realms of us analog humans! 🌟 
-->
<!--
I've had the pleasure of teaching deep learning, statistics, Python and R coding to a  range of wonderful students, from undergraduates to postgraduates from a variety of disciplines.
I was also lucky enough to share my work in a whole range of different settings, from small, informal meet-ups to major international scientific conferences, engaging with a  variety of academics and professionals from all kinds of backgrounds.
